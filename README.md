# XLPE-CABLE-PROJECT
The main reason that leads to failure of cable insulation is degradation due to age and
partial discharge. However, replacing and maintaining underground cable circuits
throughout the excavation phase is very expensive. The severity of the condition of the
cable insulation information aids in making better-informed judgments for system
planning and maintenance forecasting. In the past, machine learning models such as
the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes were used to determine the insulation health
condition of XLPE cable. The data which is provided by the Utility Analytics Network
contains different parameters like Partial Discharge, Neutral Corrosion, Service Age,
Visual Index and Health Index. The data needs preprocessing before applying Machine
Learning models. In this work focus has been given on Random Forest Model and ANN
model. The reason Random Forest was chosen over other algorithms is that it requires
approximately less time to train. Additionally, it operates swiftly even with a large
dataset and makes accurate output predictions. Even if some data are missing, Random
Forest can still be effective. In this work Random Forest Model after doing the
hyperparameter tuning provided the best results with accuracy of 98% and only 11 data
were predicted wrong out of 500 data. ANN model gave an accuracy of 97.2%. A
comparison has been made between different Models which shows that Random Forest
produces the best results.
